Age Update Logic: The age is updated in a new object but the original list is not updated.
Handling Empty List: Methods like printoldestUser() and printUsersAverageAge() can break if the list is empty (e.g., after calling clear()).
Error Messages: The output for invalid operations should be clear and descriptive, indicating why certain actions (like adding negative age) failed.
